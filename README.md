# Personal-Portfolio
My name is Abbie Murphy I am a five-year B/MS student at Brandeis University, entering year five. Each link will take you to a project repository that contains photos and walk-throughs of each project in the README. These projects are projects that I have persued to either practice skills from class, expand on those skills, or simply explore new areas of computer science. 

## AdventureAdvisor
[adventure-advisor](https://github.com/abigailmurphy/adventure-advisor)

A mobile application built using react native/ javascript. AdventureAdvisor will both plan and document your trip, using a chatGPT API key to build an itinerary based on selected parameters. The user then has the option to save their trip using async local storage on their device and add pictures and journal entries to their trips. The app also uses location to 'quick plan' the rest of the users day at a particular time and location at the touch of a button.

## Cryptography Exploration in Python
[Cryptography-Exploration](https://github.com/abigailmurphy/Cryptography-Exploration)

After being inspired by a course that I took that had some materials on security and cryptography but little application of it, I decided to try out and explore some of the applications of RSA keys in python.
