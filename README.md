# Personal-Portfolio
My name is Abbie Murphy, I am completing my B.S. in Computer Science at Brandeis University, class of 2024. I have compiled some of my projects into one place for easy access. These projects are projects that I have persued to either practice skills from class, expand on those skills, or simply explore new areas of computer science.
